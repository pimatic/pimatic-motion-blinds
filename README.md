## Retrieving Your Key

The Motion Blinds API uses a 16 character key that can be retrieved from the official "Motion Blinds" app for iOS or Android. Open the app, click the 3 dots in the top right corner, go to "Settings", go to "About MOTION", then quickly tap the screen five times. A popup will appear showing your key.
